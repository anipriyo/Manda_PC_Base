        <li><h1><b>Puri</b></h1>
            <p><h2>Spirituality and divinity echo through every by-lane of the temple city of Puri. A very popular destination of pilgrimage for Hindus, the city is sprawled along the long and pristine coastline of the Bay of Bengal, in the state of Odisha. Buzzing with devotees, who come here to pay obeisance at the Lord Jagannath Temple, Puri is also known worldwide for the larger-than-life celebrations associated with its presiding deity. While one part of the city gets busy celebrating the annual festival of Ratha Yatra (chariot procession of Lord Jagannath), that sees lakhs of footfalls, the other part on the outskirts, fringed by beaches and lakes, remains blanketed in relative calm and serenity, making it a hub for nature lovers.</h2></p>

        <li><h1><b>Darjeeling</b></h1>
            <p><h2>Sprawled over a steep mountain ridge and dotted with unending stretches of emerald green tea plantations, the quaint hill station of Darjeeling, in West Bengal, is a popular travel destination. The most in-demand attraction here is the majestic Kanchenjunga or Khangchendzonga, the third-highest peak in the world. Tourists flock to nearby peaks to watch glorious sunrises and sunsets over Kanchenjunga. Darjeeling boasts remnants of colonial-era architecture that exude a charm of their own. One of the best ways to explore the city is by riding in the 140-year-old Darjeeling Himalayan Railway that meanders through some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes in and around the hill station.</h2></p>

        <li><h1><b>Delhi</b></h1>
            <p><h2>With old monuments and busy neighbourhoods subtly merging with a vibrant and contemporary cosmopolitan world, Delhi, the capital of India, is a fascinating tourist destination. Poised along the banks of River Yamuna, Delhi, which is almost 1,000 years old, offers a mesmeric mosaic of experiences, both heritage and contemporary. While the former honour the elegant ageing of centuries-old Delhi, the latter reiterate that the capital is the heart of Indian democracy, and can keep pace with the most advanced of the metropolitans of the world.</h2></p>

        <li><h1><b>Mamallapuram</b></h1>
            <p><h2>Sitting along the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, the seaport town of Mamallapuram or Mahabalipuram, in Tamil Nadu, is a beautiful beach destination that is slowly becoming the surfing hub of the country. Speckled with several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, courtesy of the ancient Pallava dynasty (3rd - 9th century BC), who were great patrons of art and crafts, Mamallapuram holds a baffling visual treat around every corner. Its awe-inspiring cave temples, sculptures and monuments leave one marvelling at the skill of the craftsmen of that time. With its striking bas reliefs and rock-cut temples, Mamallapuram is practically an open-air museum. Many of the temples, built with granite, relate the stories from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Once a thriving port, Mamallapuram is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site complex, also famous for its seashell jewellery, seafood, cafes and markets and a breathtaking ocean-front. While you can soak in history visiting various historical sites, Mamallapuram's pristine beaches fringed by lush groves with a warm sun, invite surfers. With perfect sea waves between June and September, the beaches host surfing training sessions conducted by experts. The town is also a major stopover for visitors coming from Chennai and Puducherry.</h2></p>

From exquisite sarees to wooden toys and sculptures, Madurai is a hub of shopping, where visitors can find a fine selection of unique and handmade products. After a busy and vibrant sample of the city's bustling streets, tourists can take a respite in the serene and scenic hill stations flanking the city.

At the heart of the town, is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Brihadeeswarar Temple that was built in the 11th century and is adorned with unique carvings and sculptures, along with inscriptions that give an account of life 1,000 years ago.
